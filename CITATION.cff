  The American Economic Association's Data Editor has
  reviewed more than 1,000 empirical articles since
  July 2019, and worked with authors to improve the
  reproducibility of their research compendia
  (replication packages). Some lessons emerge from
  this work. In this presentation, I will focus on
  lessons for young scholars (students and young
  researchers), on possible lessons even for more
  seasoned researchers. Students and researchers are
  embedded within institutions, and I will discuss
  the kind of support that institutions
  (universities, data providers, compute services)
  should be providing to students, faculty, and
  researchers, for a robust, reproducible, and
  transparent science enterprise. This particular presentation has
  been shortened for presentation at the MEA-SOLE meetings in 2023.
