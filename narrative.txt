Reproducibility in the Social Sciences: Lessons learned for students, researchers, and institutions from 1,000 articles

For the past four and a half years, I have had the privilege - and the workload - of being the American Economic Association's inaugural Data Editor. For the past three years, I and a team of graduate and undergraduate students - over 100 by now - have reviewed the research compendia for more than 1,000 empirical articles, verified their completeness, and provided feedback to authors on how to fix any shortcomings. 

In my talk on December 2nd, I will talk about the criteria we apply when assessing research compendia - and why those, and not others. I will also reflect on some lessons that emerge from this work. Some of those lessons may be useful to any researcher - academic or non-academic, young or old. Others should be particularly useful for young scholars (graduate and undergraduate students, and recent Ph.Ds). But scholars are not just self-employed lone wolves - they are housed in and embedded within institutions, and I will also reflect on the kind of support that institutions (not just universities: data providers, cloud compute services) should be providing to students, faculty, and researchers. 

It is possible to create a robust, reproducible, and transparent research compendium in support of the science that we disseminate. It is also possible, but a bit more challenging, to do so at scale. I hope that you will walk away from this talk with a greater appreciation of what it takes to create and disseminate transparent and credible research.
